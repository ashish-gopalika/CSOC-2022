                        <p className='themetext'>India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. This year we celebrate 75 years of Indian independence i.e. Azaadi ka Amrit Mahotsav.
                            With this we want you all to build a software which glorify India's rich culture and heritage or solve any national level problem related to society. You can also build something to spread awareness about an issue or problem which we face in our day to day life. The event is only for those who all are a part of the Codeshack Mentorship Program.
                            So gear up to join us for 60 hours of incredible celebration of hacking.</p>
